# 12 Employee Tracker

## Description

This employee tracker app is a testimate to what relational database programming can be. Using Node.js, inquirer, and MySQL, our user is able to keep track of employees, roles, departments, budgets, and much more. When the user runs the program, the user will be prompted with a series of questions ranging from pure data presentation, all the way to creating and updating fields for current and new employees/roles/departments. A true one stop shop for most small business needs out there in the world.
